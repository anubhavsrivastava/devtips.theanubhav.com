Under the hood it will use transparently npm, bower or yarn commands to install, remove or update dependencies. It also provides a way to run all ‚Äúscripts‚Äù under script section of package json from UI and dumps the console output of the command. It can be installed as global npm module as well as locally.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/npm-gui.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>Official Site: <a href=\"https://github.com/q-nick/npm-gui\">npm-gui</a></p>\n<hr>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/ui-for-npm","tagSlugs":["/tag/java-script/","/tag/npm/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-04-18T18:05:00.738Z","description":"Set of tools that provide GUI interfaces for managing you npm packages, both global and project.","tags":["JavaScript","NPM"],"title":"Manage all of your npm packages for a project from UI"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/ui-for-npm"}}
