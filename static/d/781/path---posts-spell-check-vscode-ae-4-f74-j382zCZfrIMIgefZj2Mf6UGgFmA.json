Or have you commented your code with <code class=\"language-text\">function</code> as <code class=\"language-text\">funtcion</code>?\nYes, there is an extension for that called <code class=\"language-text\">code spell checker</code> on VS Code. There might be such extensions for other IDEs but I’ve personally used this and found it useful.</p>\n<p>Though a word of caution, it only works with spellings and not grammar as a whole. So you can get the grammar wrong, like I do in this site. Other than that, it is magic wand.</p>\n<p>It is available by default with English Spell checks and other language extensions can be installed to support them. It has multiple settings to tweak according to your needs and supports a wide variety of file extensions.</p>\n<p>To Install,\nOpen up VS Code and hit F1 and type ext, select install and type code-spell-checker hit enter and install it. You may need to reload VS Code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/codespell.gif\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>Official Site: <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker\">Code Spell Checker</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/spell-check-vscode","tagSlugs":["/tag/tools/","/tag/ide/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-04-15T18:05:00.738Z","description":"A basic spell checker that works well with camelCase code.
