It shows you the size of an imported 3rd party library the moment you import it (or several moments thereafter).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/import-cost.gif\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>It indicates the size for import + gzipped with color indicators. For heavy imports it will seek your attention by indicating the size in red colour. You can configure what size is actually small, medium, large via extensionâ€™s configuration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/import-cost-screen.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>It also supports multiple ways by which you can import a module onto your project, currently supports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default importing: <code class=\"language-text\">import Func from &#39;utils&#39;;</code></li>\n<li>Entire content importing: <code class=\"language-text\">import * as Utils from &#39;utils&#39;;</code></li>\n<li>Selective importing: <code class=\"language-text\">import {Func} from &#39;utils&#39;;</code></li>\n<li>Selective importing with alias: <code class=\"language-text\">import {orig as alias} from &#39;utils&#39;;</code></li>\n<li>Submodule importing: <code class=\"language-text\">import Func from &#39;utils/Func&#39;;</code></li>\n<li>Require: const Func = <code class=\"language-text\">require(&#39;utils&#39;).Func;</code></li>\n<li>Supports both Javascript and Typescript</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So next time you are adding a dependency to your project, make sure you know the cost!
