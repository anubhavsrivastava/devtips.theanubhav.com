The easiest way to create and share beautiful images of your code.</p>\n<p>Just head to <a href=\"https://carbon.now.sh/?bg=rgba(74%2C144%2C226%2C1)&#x26;t=material&#x26;wt=none&#x26;l=auto&#x26;ds=false&#x26;dsyoff=20px&#x26;dsblur=68px&#x26;wc=true&#x26;wa=true&#x26;pv=56px&#x26;ph=56px&#x26;ln=false&#x26;fm=Fira%20Code&#x26;fs=14px&#x26;lh=152%25&#x26;si=false&#x26;es=2x&#x26;wm=false&#x26;code=%252F%252Ftype%2520here\">Carbon</a> site and type your code in <code class=\"language-text\">//type here</code> section. Choose over theme, language and other settings. And Boom! its ready to be shared in a beautiful way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/carbon.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>With Carbon, you can import from GitHub gist. Simply append a GitHub gist id to the url, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">carbon.now.sh/&lt;GIST_ID_HERE&gt;</code>. Customize things like your image’s syntax theme, window style, and more. Save your image or Tweet a link with one click.</p>\n<p>The simple way to use it frequently is via your IDE, visit <a href=\"https://github.com/dawnlabs/carbon#community\">community</a> section to integrate with your favorite IDE.\nI use it as VS Code extension to share the code. Simply highlighting my code and using command palette search as “carbon” does the work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/carbon2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>As I notice, with everything in URL, I believe the tool will fail on Internet Explorer, as it has URL length limit. Haven’t tested though! But that’s not a concern!</p>\n<p>Official Site: <a href=\"https://dawnlabs.io/carbon\">Carbon</a></p>\n<hr>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/carbon-to-take-code-shots","tagSlugs":["/tag/tools/","/tag/code/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-04-21T18:05:00.738Z","description":"Are you impressed by code screenshot that you see twitter and online? and wonder, which IDE theme are people using? or you want to share your professional awesome code screenshot with colleague?
