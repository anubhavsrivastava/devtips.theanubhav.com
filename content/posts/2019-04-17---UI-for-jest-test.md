Many of us have written down test cases, or test suites, that are essentially based on [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) by facebook, which is a comprehensive JavaScript testing solution, works out of the box for most JavaScript projects.

The CLI is works perfectly, providing watch mode and coverage part, but all in ðŸ‘¾terminal . Here is a quick npm module that brings those things on ðŸ–¥browser, [Majestic](https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic). It is essentially GUI for jest that does not require any configuration.
