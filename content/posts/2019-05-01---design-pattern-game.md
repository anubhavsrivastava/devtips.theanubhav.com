Here is an awesome site - [Design-Pattern-Javascript](https://github.com/zoltantothcom/Design-Patterns-JavaScript), small game to get you familiar with all the 23 Gang of Four design patterns implemented in JavaScript. I like the approach to test yourself using questionnaires, something similar that I had build for HTTP status code - [What's my HTTP status code](https://httpstatuscode.netlify.com/).

The site simply shows a JS code snippet which is a pattern and gives 4 options to answer the pattern that is implemented. At the end, you get to know your score.

There is also quick reference available on the [site](http://designpatternsgame.com/patterns)

How much did I score? I scored 17/23, but to be honest, I could only get 10-12 identification at first go, rest I just eliminated other 3 options out of 4.

All the code samples on the site are taken from this [Design-Patterns-JS](https://github.com/fbeline/Design-Patterns-JS) by Felipe Beline.
