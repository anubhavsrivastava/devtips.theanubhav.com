The developer community is constantly on the move and with it, the way everyone share and interact with each others code does too. `Carbon` is meant for that! The easiest way to create and share beautiful images of your code.

Just head to [Carbon](<https://carbon.now.sh/?bg=rgba(74%2C144%2C226%2C1)&t=material&wt=none&l=auto&ds=false&dsyoff=20px&dsblur=68px&wc=true&wa=true&pv=56px&ph=56px&ln=false&fm=Fira%20Code&fs=14px&lh=152%25&si=false&es=2x&wm=false&code=%252F%252Ftype%2520here>) site and type your code in `//type here` section. Choose over theme, language and other settings. And Boom! its ready to be shared in a beautiful way.

With Carbon, you can import from GitHub gist. Simply append a GitHub gist id to the url, e.g. `carbon.now.sh/<GIST_ID_HERE>`. Customize things like your image's syntax theme, window style, and more. Save your image or Tweet a link with one click.

The simple way to use it frequently is via your IDE, visit [community](https://github.com/dawnlabs/carbon#community) section to integrate with your favorite IDE.
I use it as VS Code extension to share the code. Simply highlighting my code and using command palette search as "carbon" does the work.

As I notice, with everything in URL, I believe the tool will fail on Internet Explorer, as it has URL length limit. Haven't tested though! But that's not a concern!
